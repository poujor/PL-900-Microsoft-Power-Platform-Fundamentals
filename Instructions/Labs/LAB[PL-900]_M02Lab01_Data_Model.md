# Module 2: Introduction to the Common Data Service
## Lab: Data Modeling


Scenario
========
    
Bellows College is an educational organization with multiple buildings on campus. Campus visits are currently recorded in paper journals. The information is not captured consistently, and there are no means to collect and analyze data about the visits across the entire campus. 

Campus administration would like to modernize their visitor registration system where access to the buildings is controlled by security personnel and all visits are required to be pre-registered and recorded by their hosts.

Throughout this course, you will build applications and perform automation to enable the Bellows College administration and security personnel to manage and control access to the buildings on campus. 

In this lab, you will set up an environment, create Common Data Service (CDS) database, and create a solution to track your changes. You will also create a data model to support the following requirements:

-   R1 – Track the locations (buildings) of the campus visits
-   R2 – Record basic information to identify and track the visitors 
-   R3 – Schedule, record, and manage visits 

Finally, you will import sample data into Common Data Service.

High-level lab steps
======================

To prepare your learning environments you will:

* create a solution and publisher
* add both new and existing components required to meet the application requirements. Refer to the [data model document](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/PL-900-Microsoft-Power-Platform-Fundamentals/raw/master/Allfiles/Labs/Campus%20Management.png) for the metadata description (entities and relationships). You can hold CTRL+click or right click the link to open the data model document in a new window.

Your solution will contain several entities upon completion of all the customizations:

-   Contact
-   Building
-   Visit

## Prerequisites:

* None

Things to consider before you begin:
-----------------------------------

* Naming convention
* Data types, restrictions (e.g. max length of a name)
* Datetime formatting to support easy localization

Exercise \#1: Create Environment and Solution

Exercise \#2: Create Entities and Relationships
========================================

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will create entities and add relationships
between the entities.

Task #1: Create Building Entity and Fields
-----------------------------------------

1.  You should still have your browser open to the Campus Management solution. If not, open the Campus Management solution by following these steps:
    * Sign in to <https://make.powerapps.com> (if you are not already signed in)
    * Select **Solutions** and click to open the **Campus Management**
          solution you just created.
2.  Create Building entity

    -   Click **Done**. This will
            start provisioning the entity in background while you can start adding
            other entities and fields.

## Task #2: Create Visit Entity and Fields

The **Visit** entity will contain information about the campus visits including the building, visitor, scheduled and actual time of each visit. 

We would like to assign each visit a unique number that can be easily entered and interpreted by a visitor when asked during the visit check-in process.

> [NOTE]
> We use **Time zone independent** behavior to record date and time information because time of a visit is *always* local to the location of the building and should not change when viewed from a different time zone. 

1.  Select your **Campus Management** solution
2. Create Visit entity

   * Click **New** and select **Entity**.
   * Enter **Visit** for **Display Name**

## Task #3: Verify Data Import

1. Select the **Campus Management** solution. If you do not still have this open, navigate to make.powerapps.com and click solutions on the left pane to locate your solution.*
2. Select the **Visit** entity, then select the **Data** tab.
3. Click **Active Visits** in the top right-hand corner to display the view selector, then select **All fields**
4. If the import was successful, you should see a list of visit entries.
5. Click on any value in the **Building** column, confirm that the Building form opens in a separate window.
6. Click on any value in the **Visitor** column (you may need to scroll the view to the right), confirm that the Contact form opens in a separate window.

# Challenges

* Would you consider using *appointment* activity as part of the solution? What would it change?
* How to enforce the scheduled end to be after the scheduled start? 
* Add support for multiple meetings during a single visit.
* Secure the building access not only for external contacts but for internal staff member as well.
* Visits to certain buildings require management approval. What would the approval process change in the data model?
